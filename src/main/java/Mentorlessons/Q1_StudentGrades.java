    A teacher issues three tests to a class of 10 students.
    The grades on these tests are integers in the range 0 to 100.
    The teacher has asked you to develop an application to keep track of each student's grades and average,
    the average grade for each test and the average of the class as a whole.
    The application should allow a user to input three test grades for each student,
    then compute each student's average and the class average.
    If the user enters an invalid grade, the application should issue an error message and
    prompt the user to input the grade again.
